- Teleportation effect, glitchy digital distortion with a soft whoosh. Length: 5 seconds
- Dark eerie drone with distant whispers, creepy, slow build tension. Length: 120 seconds
- Sudden horror jump scare sting, sharp violin hit, cinematic. Length: 1 second
- Metal scraping slowly in a dark tunnel, echoing and ominous. Length: 20 seconds
- Explosion with debris scattering, deep bass, cinematic realism. Length: 4 seconds
- Building collapsing, rumbling concrete, dust and debris falling. Length: 25 seconds
- Fire crackling intensely, wood burning, close-up detail. Length: 80 seconds
- Gunshot in a large empty warehouse, loud echo decay. Length: 2 seconds
- Retro arcade coin insert sound, 8-bit style. Length: 1 second
- Level up chime, bright, rewarding, fantasy RPG style. Length: 2 seconds
- Error buzzer, short, digital, UI feedback. Length: 1 second
- Menu navigation clicks, soft futuristic interface sounds. Length: 3 seconds
- Layered soundscape: rain, thunder, footsteps, and distant sirens all blending naturally. Length: 90 seconds
- Rapid sequence of three impacts: metal hit, glass break, wood crack, spaced evenly. Length: 4 seconds
- Sound moving from left to right stereo field: passing motorcycle. Length: 5 seconds
- Close vs far perspective transition: footsteps approaching then fading away. Length: 6 seconds
- Tape stop sub drop, a massive sub-bass note that mimics a vinyl record or tape machine being turned off, the pitch and speed drop simultaneously, causing the high-end harmonics to smear and thicken as the sound grinds to a halt at a sub-sonic frequency. Length: 11 seconds
- Gravel and leaves footsteps, the sound of a hard boot stepping onto dry leaves or gravel, crisp and natural with detailed texture. Length: 11 seconds
- Ghostship moan, a massive, deep wooden groan with a low-frequency moan, like heavy timber under immense structural tension, swaying slowly, processed with long, dark wooden room reverb for a sense of scale. Length: 11 seconds
- Bicycle chain, a continuous metallic whirring sound of a chain moving over sprockets, with individual teeth catching the links, processed with resonant band-pass filter to emphasize metallic singing. Length: 11 seconds
- Warp drive, a sound that starts with a massive suck-back of ambient noise, followed by a supersonic crack and high-pitched zing that disappears into the distance, giving the sense of stretching space-time. Length: 11 seconds
- Ice cubes, high-pitched musical clinking of hard ice hitting a thin glass, bright resonant ring with subtle liquid sloshing around the edges. Length: 11 seconds
- Paper shuffle, the sound of a thick stack of heavy bond paper being squared up on a desk, dry papery thud with a quick fanning sound as air moves between the pages. Length: 11 seconds
